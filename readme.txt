Lets you add consistent schema markup code to enhance your site's content display on the main search engines: Google, Yahoo and Bing.

== Description ==

**Schema for WordPress** lets you easily insert markup consistent with schema.org which enhances your search results on the major search engines.

Initially you will need to import a file to a sql table but the plugin will include an import function to allow for easy updates as the schema grow.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I ask questions =
Via the plugin homepage at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/schema-for-wordpress/ or the main web site http://schemaforwordpress.com/.

Check to see if you have two or more schema short codes next to each other - there should be a space in between.

Fixes major bug which prevented schema being inserted!

Security updates.  Thanks to Maxim Voldachinsky for resolving these bugs.

No changes to the plugin but the schema need to be updated.  This needs to be done at the SQL table level and the exising content needs to be replaced.
This should not affect any of your already marked up code as the id numbers have not changed.

Everything works under ideal conditions so we are going live.
